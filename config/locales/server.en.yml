      ** Apps and the App Store are planned features. They are not currently live. [Join in the discussion about this plan here](/t/apps-and-app-store).**

      Apps provide civic services, help with civic issues or add to civic life in a place. The Civically app store is the civic version of the app store on your mobile phone. All apps must be open source and be hosted on either GitHub or BitBucket.

      The process for adding an app to Civically is as follows:

      1. Complete the app petition wizard.

       a. Repository Url: Enter the url to your open source repository on either GitHub or BitBucket. Do not add a .git extension. The url will be used as link to your repository.

       b. Add a name for your app and a description of what it does. The name will be used as the title of your app petition and the description will be the first post in the petition topic.

       c. Add a place. If the app is specific to a place, e.g. it allows people to get alerts about planning applications in the City of Perth, then add that place here. If it is not specific to a place, click next.

      2. Gather support for your app petition. Each app petition needs at least 50 votes before it will be considered for addition to Civically.

      3. The app is added to staging.civically.io to test that the functionality works as described. All apps must be approved by a Civically tester whilst on staging. All apps must stay on staging for a minimum of 1 week.

      4. When an app passes staging it is subject to a final approval by a place or site moderator.

      5. If the app receives final approval, it is made available on the Civically app store and the app petition topic is converted into a review topic for the app.
